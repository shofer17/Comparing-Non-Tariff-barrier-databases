# Comparing Non Tariff barrier databses
This repo contains all code related to my Bachelor's Thesis at the University of St. Gallen. 
The thesis tries to estimate the impact of Non-Tariff Measures on trade costs. Further, it compares the UNCTAD TRAINS database and the Global Trade Alert database in how they differ and how well they can explain trade costs.
The files "0 data prep.R", "1 combine data.R", and "2 analysis.R" contain the main data preparation and analysis. "Monte Carlo" contains all Monte Carlo Simulations run as described in the thesis. "Help files" contains several scripts that were needed in the process, but that were not part of the main data preparation work. That included constructing the "Comprehensiveness of Reporting Index" (CRI), generation of conversion tables for names and ISO codes, finding affected countries for observations in the TRAINS database, and others smaller tasks. Some scripts contain code and data preparation that was intended for further analysis that was later determined to be out of scope. "Archive" contains codes that are not relevant for the current version of the thesis but that used to be at an earlier point.
